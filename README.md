# Cpp_Projects
In this repository there are some C++ projects developed entirely by me.
  **_LBFGS_main_** is a script oriented to optimize, via _Limited  Broyden-Fletcher- Goldfarb-Shanno_  method, a given function. It works with the following headers: 
   -**_Parameters.h_**: there are all the control parameters to manage the method-
   -**_algebra.h_**:there are defined all the algebraic operations that L-BFGS needs.
   -**_definitions.h**: there is defined data structure used.
   -**_functional.h_**: there is defined the function to being optimized and its gradient.
