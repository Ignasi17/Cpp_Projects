# Cpp_Projects
In this repository there are some C++ projects developed entirely by me.


  **_LBFGS_main_** is a script oriented to optimize, via _Limited  Broyden-Fletcher- Goldfarb-Shanno_  method, a given function. It works with the following headers: 
  
  
   -**_Parameters.h_**: there are all the control parameters to manage the method and data structure.
   
   
   -**_algebra.h_**:there are defined all the algebraic operations that L-BFGS needs
   
   
   -**_functional.h_**: there is defined the function to being optimized and its gradient.
   
   **_QR_**: is a script to solve a linear equation system using the _**QR**_ decomposition.
